 * @brief Used when we expect a discrete output, but also collect the hidden representation in the form
 * of a vector of floating point values.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This class expects a causal network. The reason being is that we currently only support 
 * the hidden representation of the last symbol. In a non-causal model, the hidden representation 
 * can be changed by future values, but in a non-causal model they cannot. Hence, in a non-causal model 
 * all hidden representations have to be analyzed, but in a causal model it is enough to look at the last 
 * symbol at a time, assuming that all prefixes of the current string are known.
