# Connector files

## What are connectors?

Those files are what we need to connect with neural networks (or other Python-implemented oracles). 

## How to use them?

If you have a custom oracle such as a neural network that you want to connect with, then you need to implement a connector for that. 
Be aware of what the SUL implementation that you are about to use needs as input. We provide a template to use as well (**nn_connector_template.py**)
