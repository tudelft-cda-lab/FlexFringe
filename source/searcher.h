/*
 *  RTI (real-time inference)
 *  Searcher.cpp, the header file for the search routines
 *  Currently, only a simple greedy (best-first) routine is implemented, search routines will be added later.
 *
 *  A refinement is either a point (merge), split, or color (adding of a new state) in the current real-time automaton, as in:
 *  Sicco Verwer and Mathijs de Weerdt and Cees Witteveen (2007),
 *  An algorithm for learning real-time automata,
 *  In Maarten van Someren and Sophia Katrenko and Pieter Adriaans (Eds.),
 *  Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual Machine Learning Conference of Belgium and the Netherlands (Benelearn),
 *  pp. 128-135.

 *
 *  I will try to keep this software updated and will also try to add new statistics or search methods.
 *  Also I will add comments to the source in the near future.
 *
 *  Feel free to adapt the code to your needs, please inform me of (potential) improvements.
