RNG Seeding
===========

Random number generator seeding is available in two forms: seed values and random number engines.

- Seed values are passed as unsigned integers. For example, to generate a draw from a normal distribution N(1,2) with seed value 1776:

.. code:: cpp

    stats::rnorm(1,2,1776);

- Random engines in StatsLib use the 64-bit Mersenne-Twister generator (``std::mt19937_64``) and are passed by reference. For example:

.. code:: cpp

    std::mt19937_64 engine(1776);
    stats::rnorm(1,2,engine);
