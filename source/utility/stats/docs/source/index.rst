Introduction
============

StatsLib is a templated C++ library of statistical distribution functions, featuring unique compile-time computing capabilities and seamless integration with several popular linear algebra libraries.

**Features**

- A header-only library of probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions, quantile functions, and random sampling methods.
- Functions are written in C++11 ``constexpr`` format, enabling the library to operate as both a compile-time and run-time computation engine.
- Designed with a simple **R**-like syntax.
- Optional vector-matrix functionality, with wrappers to support:
 - STL vectors
 - `Armadillo <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>`_
 - `Blaze <https://bitbucket.org/blaze-lib/blaze>`_
 - `Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php>`_
* Matrix-based operations are parallelizable with OpenMP.
* Released under a permissive, non-GPL license.
